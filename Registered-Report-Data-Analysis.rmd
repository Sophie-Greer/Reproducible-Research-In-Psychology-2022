## Load the data & get it ready for analysis

```{r load data}
## 116 total subjects

my_data <- read.csv("sophie_report_data.csv")
```

```{r data}
## 116 total subjects

summary(my_data)
```

```{r tidy the data}
my_data %>% 
  select("sexuality", "gender", "healthcare_quality")

## Exploratory analysis

```{r descriptive statistics}

## Data visualization

```{r boxplot 1}
## Quality of healthcare stratified by sexuality

my_data %>%
  ggplot() + 
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = sexuality, y = healthcare_quality), fill = "aquamarine", color = "darkmagenta") +
    labs(
      x = "Sexuality", 
      y = "Quality of Healthcare", 
      title = "Quality of Healthcare Stratified by Patients' Sexualities"
    )
```

```{r boxplot 2}
## Quality of healthcare stratified by gender

my_data %>%
  ggplot() + 
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = gender, y = healthcare_quality), fill = "darkolivegreen1", color = "lightskyblue") +
    labs(
      x = "Gender", 
      y = "Quality of Healthcare", 
      title = "Quality of Healthcare Stratified by Patients' Gender Identities"
    )
```

```{r grouped barplot 1}
## Quality of healthcare stratified by sexuality and gender

my_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sexuality, y = healthcare_quality, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      x = "Sexuality", 
      y = "Quality of Healthcare", 
      title = "Quality of Healthcare Stratified by Patients' Sexualities and Gender Identities"
    )
```

## Data analysis 

```{r ANOVA}
res.aov2 <- aov(healthcare_quality ~ sexuality * gender, data = my_data)
summary(res.aov2)
```

```{r TukeyHSD}
TukeyHSD(res.aov2)
```
